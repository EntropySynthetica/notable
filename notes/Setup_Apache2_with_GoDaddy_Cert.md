# Setup Apache2 with GoDaddy Cert
Created Monday 21 May 2018

Three files will be needed.  

Private Key, generated on the web server.  

Signed Cert, returned from the CA

CA Intermedate Cert, can be Downloaded from <https://certs.godaddy.com/repository/gd_bundle-g2-g1.crt>

Assuming the following file names,

Priv Key = priv.key
Cert = mycert.crt
CA = gd_bundle-g2-g1.crt

Create a PEM file from these 2,

`cat mycert.crt gd_bundle-g2-g1.crt > mycert.pem`

In the Conf file for the site make sure to add the following lines, 

```
SSLCertificateFile /etc/apache2/ssl/mycert.pem
SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/apache2/ssl/priv.key
```

reload apache with

`sudo service apache2 reload`

Site can be verified with

`openssl s_client -showcerts -connect www.mysite.com:443`

`openssl verify -CAfile chain.pem mycert.pem`


## Verify Cert from CLI
`openssl x509 -text -noout -in certificate.crt `

## Verify Priv key matches cert
For your SSL certificate: `openssl x509 –noout –modulus –in <file>.crt | openssl md5`

For your RSA private key: `openssl rsa –noout –modulus –in <file>.key | openssl md5`

For your CSR: `openssl req -noout -modulus -in <file>.csr | openssl md5`

You just need to replace <file> with your file’s name. If all the three match, the SSL certificate matches the Private Key.
