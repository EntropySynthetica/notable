# Kubernetes Lab Setup

The following will detail creating a Kubernetes lab and setting up a test workload

Kubernetes is a portable, extensible, open-source platform for managing containerized workloads and services, that facilitates both declarative configuration and automation. It has a large, rapidly growing ecosystem. Kubernetes services, support, and tools are widely available. It was developed by Google using the Go Programming Language.

## Requirements

* Ubuntu Linux 16.04 or newer with internet access.
* Firewall open TCP ports 80, 443, 6443, and 30000 to 32600

## What will be installed?

* Kubernetes will be installed via K3S.
* Docker will be used as a container runtime.
* kubectl will be used to manage the node.

## Kubernetes Components

* **kube-apiserver**  - The API server is a component of the Kubernetes control plane that exposes the Kubernetes API. The API server is the front end for the Kubernetes control plane.
* **etcd**  -  Consistent and highly-available key value store used as Kubernetes' backing store for all cluster data.  In this lab a SQLite Database will take the place of etcd. 
* **kube-scheduler**  - Control plane component that watches for newly created Pods with no assigned node, and selects a node for them to run on. Factors taken into account for scheduling decisions include: individual and collective resource requirements, hardware/software/policy constraints, affinity and anti-affinity specifications, data locality, inter-workload interference, and deadlines.
* **kube-controller-manager**  - Control Plane component that runs controller processes. Logically, each controller is a separate process, but to reduce complexity, they are all compiled into a single binary and run in a single process.
* **kubelet**  - An agent that runs on each node in the cluster. It makes sure that containers are running in a Pod. The kubelet takes a set of PodSpecs that are provided through various mechanisms and ensures that the containers described in those PodSpecs are running and healthy. The kubelet doesnâ€™t manage containers which were not created by Kubernetes.
* **kube-proxy**  - maintains network rules on nodes. These network rules allow network communication to your Pods from network sessions inside or outside of your cluster.

## Install Prerequisite packages. 

`sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl gnupg-agent software-properties-common`

## Install Docker

### Get the Docker GPG key and add it to apt
`curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -`

### Add the Docker Repo
```
sudo add-apt-repository \
   "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
   $(lsb_release -cs) \
   stable"
```

### Install Docker
`sudo apt update`

`sudo apt install docker-ce`

## Verify Docker is running

### Add your user to docker
`sudo usermod -aG docker your-user`

You will need to log out and back in after adding yourself to the group. 

Check Docker Version
`docker --version`

Show running Containers
`docker ps -a`

[Additional Docker Install Notes](Install Docker on Ubuntu.md)

## Install Kubectl

### Add Google Kubernetes GPG key
`curl -s https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg | sudo apt-key add -`

### Add the Google Kubernetes Repo
`echo "deb https://apt.kubernetes.io/ kubernetes-xenial main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list`

### Install kubectl
`sudo apt update`

`sudo apt install kubectl`

### Verify kubectl works
`kubectl version --client`

[Additional kubectl Notes](kubectl Notes.md)


## Install K3S

Download the K3s Binary, the links can be found at https://github.com/rancher/k3s/releases/latest
example:
`curl -OL https://github.com/rancher/k3s/releases/download/v1.18.8%2Bk3s1/k3s`

Move K3S to the proper directory
`chmod +x k3s `

`sudo mv k3s /usr/local/bin`

Test with 
`k3s --version`

Start K3s with 
`sudo k3s server --docker &`

[Additional k3s Notes](K3S Notes.md)

## Setup kubectl to talk to the cluster

Once K3S is up and running it will generate a config file at /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml
To get kubectl to talk to k3s we need to feed this config file to kubectl.  

Switch to your home directory
`cd ~`

Make a directory named .kube
`mkdir .kube`

Copy the kube config file into the .kube folder 
`sudo cp /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml ~/.kube/config`

fixup the permissions on the config file

`sudo chown sysadmin:sysadmin ~/.kube/config`

Verify kubectl can see the cluster with 
`kubectl get nodes`

## Add a deployment to the Kubernetes cluster

Create a deployment using a test webserver.
`kubectl create deployment demo --image=monachus/rancher-demo:latest`

Verify the deployment is running
`kubectl get deploy`

## Expose the deployment using a service. 

Expose the deployment using a nodeport service
`kubectl create service nodeport demo --node-port=31337 --tcp=8080:8080`

Verify the Service exists
`kubectl get service`

Point your web browser to http://<node IP>:31337 to access the workload.

## Scale up the service. 
`kubectl scale deployments/demo --replicas=4`
